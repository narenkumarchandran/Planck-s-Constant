## **Calculation Details**
### **Formula Used**
\[
v_0 = \frac{h}{e \cdot \nu} - \phi
\]  
where:  
- **\( v_0 \)** = Stopping potential (V)  
- **\( h \)** = Planck's constant (Js)  
- **\( e \)** = Charge of an electron (Coulombs)  
- **\( \nu \)** = Frequency of incident light (Hz)  
- **\( \phi \)** = Work function of the metallic film (eV)
